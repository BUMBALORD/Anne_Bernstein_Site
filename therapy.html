                    <p>As a psychologist with more than 30 years experience, I see couples, families and individuals.  I begin by getting to know you and the challenges or difficulties you now face.  Together we work to discover how to mobilize your strengths to work through ways of thinking, feeling, and behaving that are no longer working for you.   I attend to the relational, social and cultural influences that provide the context for what you may be experiencing.  Together we work to discover new ways of being that allow you to accomplish your goals for yourself and your relationships. Direct and interactive, my therapeutic approach incorporates training in different treatment modalities–including relational, systemic, and narrative approaches– individually tailored to fit the nature of your situation and your goals.</p>
                    <br>

                    <p>I provide psychotherapy or counseling to people of all ages and from a wide range of cultural backgrounds.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>Couples who are just getting together and couples with have been together for decades, married and unmarried, heterosexual and gay or lesbian.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>Families in which the adults are the parents of all the children and “yours, mine, and ours” families, families created by birth and families created by adoption, families in which the children are the biological offspring of their mommies and daddies and those in which donor sperm or ova or surrogacy are part of building a family, single parent families and families with three or more parents.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>Therapy usually involves weekly meetings, although after we have clarified your needs and goals that may become less frequent.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>Alternatively, I am available for concentrated work on family issues when out-of-town relatives can only be available on a time-limited, intermittent basis.  This generally involves adults and their parents, adult siblings, or ex-spouses who co-parent at a distance.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>My specialties include: couple therapy; family transitions, that is, separation, divorce, and new partners; stepfamilies, adoptive families and families formed by sperm/ova donation and surrogacy, as well as children's experience of diverse family forms; parenting and co-parenting.</p>

                    <hr>
                    <p>I am available for consultation to mental health professionals.  Please call to discuss how I can be helpful.</p>

                    <p><strong>Fees:</strong> Please call me to discuss my fee, as it varies depending on the service provided.  I am on a number of PPO (not HMO) panels.  Check with your insurer as to whether they will cover some or most of my services, as contracts and terms of service keep changing and only they can give you the most up-to-date information.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p><strong>Cancellations:</strong> I ask people to give me 24 hours notice if they need to cancel an appointment.  Less than 24 hours notice results in a charge for the missed session.  You are responsible for this charge, as health insurers do not cover missed appointments.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p><strong>Confidentiality:</strong> What you say in session, and any records of the work together are confidential and will not be revealed to anyone without your express written permission, except as required by law.  Circumstances that require disclosure include: reasonable suspicion of child, dependent or elder abuse or neglect, when a client presents a danger to self or others, or when you place your mental status at issue in litigation that you initiate.</p>
